We analyse data from 212,102 vaccinated individuals within the REACT-2 programme in England, which uses self-administered lateral flow antibody tests in sequential cross-sectional community samples; 71,923 (33.9\%) received at least one dose of BNT162b2 vaccine and 139,067 (65.6\%) received ChAdOx1. For both vaccines, antibody positivity peaks 4-5 weeks after first dose and then declines. At least 21 days after second dose of BNT162b2, close to 100\% of respondents test positive, while for ChAdOx1, this is significantly reduced, particularly in the oldest age groups (72.7\% [70.9–74.4] at ages 75 years and above). For both vaccines, antibody positivity decreases with age, and is higher in females and those with previous infection. Antibody positivity is lower in transplant recipients, obese individuals, smokers and those with specific comorbidities. These groups will benefit from additional vaccine doses.},

	abstract = {Background Case detection underestimates the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the first COVID-19 wave, we estimated the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors across Canada. Study Design and Methods This serial cross-sectional study was conducted between May 9 and July 21, 2020 from blood donors donating at all Canadian Blood Services locations. We used the Abbott Architect assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from retention plasma. Seroprevalence was standardized to population-level demographics and assay characteristics were adjusted using the Rogan-Gladen equation. Results were stratified by region, age, ethnicity, ABO groups, and quantiles of material and social deprivation indices. Temporal trends were evaluated at 2-week intervals. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression compared SARS-CoV-2 reactive to non-reactive donors by sociodemographic variables. Results Overall 552/74642 donors, had detectable antibodies, adjusted seroprevalence was 7.0/1000 donors (95\% CI; 6.3, 7.6). Prevalence was differential by geography, Ontario had the highest rate, 8.8/1000 donors (7.8, 9.8), compared to the Atlantic region 4.5/1000 donors (2.6, 6.4); adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.2 (1.5, 3.3). Donors that self-identified as an ethnic minority were more likely than white donors to be sero-reactive aOR 1.5 (1.2, 1.9). No temporal trends were observed. Discussion Worldwide, blood services have leveraged their operational capacity to inform public health. While {\textgreater}99\% of Canadians did not show humoral evidence of past infection, we found regional variability and disparities by ethnicity. Seroprevalence studies will continue to play a pivotal role in evaluating public health policies by identifying trends and monitor disparities.},

	abstract = {We systematically evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity in a provincial cohort to understand the local epidemiology of COVID-19 and support evidence-based public health decisions. Residual blood samples were collected for serology testing over 5-day periods monthly from June 2020 to January 2021 from six clinical laboratories across the province of Alberta, Canada. A total of 93,993 individual patient samples were tested with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody assay with positives confirmed using a spike antibody assay. Population-adjusted SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity was 0.92\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91 to 0.93\%) shortly after the first COVID-19 wave in June 2020, increasing to 4.63\% (95\% CI: 4.61 to 4.65\%) amid the second wave in January 2021. There was no significant difference in seropositivity between males and females (1.39\% versus 1.27\%; P = 0.11). Ages with highest seropositivity were 0 to 9 years (2.71\%, 95\% CI: 1.64 to 3.78\%) followed by 20 to 29 years (1.58\%, 95\% CI: 1.12 to 2.04\%), with the lowest rates seen in those aged 70 to 79 (0.79\%, 95\% CI: 0.65 to 0.93\%) and {\textgreater}80 (0.78\%, 95\% CI: 0.60 to 0.97\%). Compared to the seronegative group, seropositive patients inhabited geographic areas with lower household income (\$87,500 versus \$97,500; P {\textless} 0.001), larger household sizes, and higher proportions of people with education levels of secondary school or lower, as well as immigrants and visible minority groups (all P {\textless} 0.05). A total of 53.7\% of seropositive individuals were potentially undetected cases with no prior positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test (NAAT). Antibodies were detectable in some patients up to 9 months post positive NAAT result. This seroprevalence study will continue to inform public health decisions by identifying at-risk demographics and geographical areas.
IMPORTANCE Using SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, we assessed the proportion of people in Alberta, Canada (population 4.4 million) positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating previous infection, during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic (prior to vaccination programs). Linking these results with sociodemographic population data provides valuable information as to which groups of the population are more likely to have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus to help facilitate public health decision-making and interventions. We also compared seropositivity data with previous COVID-19 molecular testing results. Absence of antibody and molecular testing were highly correlated (95\% negative concordance). Positive antibody correlation with a previous positive molecular test was low, suggesting the possibility of mild/asymptomatic infection or other reasons leading individuals from seeking medical attention. Our data highlight that the true estimate of population prevalence of COVID-19 is likely best informed by combining data from both serology and molecular testing.},

	abstract = {We have previously used composite reference standards and latent class analysis (LCA) to evaluate the performance of laboratory assays in the presence of tarnished gold standards. Here, we apply these techniques to repeated, cross-sectional study of Canadian blood donors, whose sera underwent parallel testing with four separate SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. We designed a repeated cross-sectional design with random cross-sectional sampling of all available retention samples (n = 1500/month) for a 12 -month period from April 2020 until March 2021. Each sample was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using four assays an Abbott Architect assay targeting the nucleocapsid antigen (Abbott-NP, Abbott, Chicago IL) and three in-house IgG ELISAs recognizing distinct recombinant viral antigens: full-length spike glycoprotein (Spike), spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (NP). We used two analytic approaches to estimate SAR-CoV-2 seroprevalence: a composite reference standard and LCA. Using LCA to estimate true seropositivity status based on the results of the four antibody tests, we estimated that seroprevalence increased from 0.8\% (95\% CI: 0.5–1.4\%) in April 2020 to 6.3\% (95\% CI: 5.1–7.6\%) in March 2021. Our study provides further support for the use of LCA in upcoming public health crises, epidemics, and pandemics when a gold standard assay may not be available or identifiable.
IMPORTANCE Here, we describe an approach to estimating seroprevalence in a low prevalence setting when multiple assays are available and yet no known gold standard exists. Because serological studies identify cases through both diagnostic testing and surveillance, and otherwise silent, unrecognized infections, serological data can be used to estimate the true infection fatality ratio of a disease. However, seroprevalence studies rely on assays with imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Seroreversion (loss of antibody response) also occurs over time, and with the advent of vaccination, distinction of antibody response resulting from vaccination as opposed to antibody response due to infection has posed an additional challenge. Our approach indicates that seroprevalence on Canadian blood donors by the end of March 2021was less than 10\%. Our study supports the use of latent class analysis in upcoming public health crises, epidemics, and pandemics when a gold standard assay may not be available or identifiable.},

	abstract = {Background Many studies report the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. We aimed to synthesize seroprevalence data to better estimate the level and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identify high-risk groups, and inform public health decision making. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched publication databases, preprint servers, and grey literature sources for seroepidemiological study reports, from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. We included studies that reported a sample size, study date, location, and seroprevalence estimate. We corrected estimates for imperfect test accuracy with Bayesian measurement error models, conducted meta-analysis to identify demographic differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and meta-regression to identify study-level factors associated with seroprevalence. We compared region-specific seroprevalence data to confirmed cumulative incidence. PROSPERO: CRD42020183634. Results We identified 968 seroprevalence studies including 9.3 million participants in 74 countries. There were 472 studies (49\%) at low or moderate risk of bias. Seroprevalence was low in the general population (median 4.5\%, IQR 2.4–8.4\%); however, it varied widely in specific populations from low (0.6\% perinatal) to high (59\% persons in assisted living and long-term care facilities). Median seroprevalence also varied by Global Burden of Disease region, from 0.6\% in Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania to 19.5\% in Sub-Saharan Africa (p{\textless}0.001). National studies had lower seroprevalence estimates than regional and local studies (p{\textless}0.001). Compared to Caucasian persons, Black persons (prevalence ratio [RR] 3.37, 95\% CI 2.64–4.29), Asian persons (RR 2.47, 95\% CI 1.96–3.11), Indigenous persons (RR 5.47, 95\% CI 1.01–32.6), and multi-racial persons (RR 1.89, 95\% CI 1.60–2.24) were more likely to be seropositive. Seroprevalence was higher among people ages 18–64 compared to 65 and over (RR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.11–1.45). Health care workers in contact with infected persons had a 2.10 times (95\% CI 1.28–3.44) higher risk compared to health care workers without known contact. There was no difference in seroprevalence between sex groups. Seroprevalence estimates from national studies were a median 18.1 times (IQR 5.9–38.7) higher than the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence, but there was large variation between Global Burden of Disease regions from 6.7 in South Asia to 602.5 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Notable methodological limitations of serosurveys included absent reporting of test information, no statistical correction for demographics or test sensitivity and specificity, use of non-probability sampling and use of non-representative sample frames. Discussion Most of the population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public health measures must be improved to protect disproportionately affected groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, until vaccine-derived herd immunity is achieved. Improvements in serosurvey design and reporting are needed for ongoing monitoring of infection prevalence and the pandemic response.},

	abstract = {Background: The evolving proportion of the population considered immunologically naive versus primed for more efficient immune memory response to SARS-CoV-2 has implications for risk assessment. We sought to chronicle vaccine- and infection-induced seroprevalence across the first 7 waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia, Canada.
Methods: During 8 cross-sectional serosurveys conducted between March 2020 and August 2022, we obtained anonymized residual sera from children and adults who attended an outpatient laboratory network in the Lower Mainland (Greater Vancouver and Fraser Valley). We used at least 3 immunoassays per serosurvey to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antibodies. We assessed any seroprevalence (vaccineor infection-induced, or both), defined by positivity on any 2 assays, and infection-induced seroprevalence, also defined by dual-assay positivity but requiring both antinucleocapsid and antispike detection. We used estimates of infection-induced seroprevalence to explore underascertainment of infections by surveillance case reports.
Results: By January 2021, we estimated that any seroprevalence remained less than 5\%, increasing with vaccine rollout to 56\% by May–June 2021, 83\% by September–October 2021 and 95\% by March 2022. Infection-induced seroprevalence remained less than 15\% through September–October 2021, increasing across Omicron waves to 42\% by March 2022 and 61\% by July–August 2022. By August 2022, 70\%–80\% of children younger than 20 years and 60\%–70\% of adults aged 20–59 years had been infected, but fewer than half of adults aged 60 years and older had been infected. Compared with estimates of infection-induced seroprevalence, surveillance case reports underestimated infections 12-fold between September 2021 and March 2022 and 92-fold between March 2022 and August 2022.
Interpretation: By August 2022, most children and adults younger than 60 years had evidence of both SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection. As previous evidence suggests that a history of both exposures may induce stronger, more durable hybrid immunity than either exposure alone, older adults — who have the lowest infection rates but highest risk of severe outcomes — continue to warrant prioritized vaccination.},

	abstract = {We monitored the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (anti-N; proxy of natural infection) and spike protein (anti-S; proxy for humoral immunity) antibodies in blood donors across Canada from January to November 2021. The first and second doses of vaccine were deployed over this time. Anti-N seroprevalence remained low overall (about 5\% or lower) from January to November but was higher in racialized groups, younger age groups, and those living in materially deprived neighborhoods. Anti-S seroprevalence corresponded with the roll out of vaccines across the country, increasing in April in older donors and then progressively to younger age groups consistent with vaccination policies targeting oldest to youngest. By November, close to 100\% of blood donors were positive for anti-S. Anti-S concentrations peaked by July and began waning by September to November particularly in older donors. These data have informed national and provincial public health policy in Canada throughout vaccination rollout.
IMPORTANCE Throughout the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, our blood donor seroprevalence study has informed Canadian public health policy at national and provincial levels. We describe the only continuously running national seroprevalence study in Canada, which spans the full length of the pandemic and per capita is one of the largest programs in the world. The benefit of seroprevalence studies is that they identify a broad range of asymptomatic and symptomatic infection histories that may not be identified with active SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing programs or when case definitions change. As vaccination was deployed in Canada, we estimated the proportion of donors with vaccine-related antibodies and developed population-level estimates of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody concentrations. Monthly predictive mathematical models and our results engaged public health organizations in new ways. In the future, we intend to continue to expand on these interactions with provincial and national public health teams.},

	abstract = {We compared the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies in blood donors across Canadian regions in 2021. The seroprevalence was the highest in Alberta and the Prairies, and it was so low in Atlantic Canada that few correlates were observed. Being male and of young age were predictive of seropositivity. Racialization was associated with higher seroprevalence in British Columbia and Ontario but not in Alberta and the Prairies. Living in a materially deprived neighborhood predicted higher seroprevalence, but it was more linear across quintiles in Alberta and the Prairies, whereas in British Columbia and Ontario, the most affluent 60\% were similarly low and the most deprived 40\% similarly elevated. Living in a more socially deprived neighborhood (more single individuals and one parent families) was associated with lower seroprevalence in British Columbia and Ontario but not in Alberta and the Prairies. These data show striking variability in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence across regions by social determinants of health.
IMPORTANCE Canadian blood donors are a healthy adult population that shows clear disparities associated with racialization and material deprivation. This underscores the pervasiveness of the socioeconomic gradient on SARS-CoV-2 infections in Canada. We identify regional differences in the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and social determinants of health. Cross-Canada studies, such as ours, are rare because health information is under provincial jurisdiction and is not available in sufficient detail in national data sets, whereas other national seroprevalence studies have insufficient sample sizes for regional comparisons. Ours is the largest seroprevalence study in Canada. An important strength of our study is the interpretation input from a public health team that represented multiple Canadian provinces. Our blood donor seroprevalence study has informed Canadian public health policy at national and provincial levels since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.},

	abstract = {Objectives Few studies reported COVID-19 cases in schools during the 2020/21 academic year in a setting of uninterrupted in-person schooling. The main objective was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among school staff in Vancouver public schools.
Design Cumulative incident COVID-19 cases among all students and school staff based on public health data, with an embedded cross-sectional serosurvey among a school staff sample that was compared to period, age, sex and geographical location-weighted data from blood donors.
Setting Vancouver School District (British Columbia, Canada) from kindergarten to grade 12.
Participants Active school staff enrolled from 3 February to 23 April 2021 with serology testing from 10 February to 15 May 2021.
Main outcome measures SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among school staff, based on spike (S)-based (unvaccinated staff) or N-based serology testing (vaccinated staff).
Results Public health data showed the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 among students attending in-person was 9.8 per 1000 students (n=47 280), and 13 per 1000 among school staff (n=7071). In a representative sample of 1689 school staff, 78.2\% had classroom responsibilities, and spent a median of 17.6 hours in class per week (IQR: 5.0–25 hours). Although 21.5\% (363/1686) of surveyed staff self-reported close contact with a COVID-19 case outside of their household (16.5\% contacts were school-based), 5 cases likely acquired the infection at school based on viral testing. Sensitivity/Specificity-adjusted seroprevalence in 1556/1689 staff (92.1\%) was 2.3\% (95\% CI: 1.6\% to 3.2\%), comparable to a sex, age, date and residency area-weighted seroprevalence of 2.6\% (95\% CI: 2.2\% to 3.1\%) among 5417 blood donors.
Conclusion Seroprevalence among staff was comparable to a reference group of blood donors from the same community. These data show that in-person schooling could be safely maintained during the 2020/21 school year with mitigation measures, in a large school district in Vancouver, Canada.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The healthy donor effect has been mentioned as a methodologic problem in blood donor health research. The aim of this study was to investigate different elements of the healthy donor effect. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: First, recent donors ({\textless}4 years registered as a donor) were compared with the general population. Second, active and lapsed donors were compared. Third, short-career donors ({\textless}14 donations) were compared with long-career donors ({\textgreater}37 donations). Various health and lifestyle indicators were used as outcome measures. RESULTS: Compared to the general population, recent donors had a better self-rated health (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.61), visited the general practitioner (GP) less often (OR, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.60-0.72), and were less often treated by a specialist (OR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.75-0.93). Recent donors also exhibited a healthier lifestyle compared to the general population. When examining active versus lapsed donors, similar results were found in favor of active donors. With respect to donation career, long-career donors were healthier than short-career donors, but effects were less strong; the ORs were 1.33 (95\% CI, 1.15-1.54) for self-rated health, 0.85 (95\% CI, 0.76-0.94) for GP visit, and 0.83 (95\% CI, 0.68-1.00) for specialist treatment. When comparing long- and short-career donors on lifestyle indicators, there were barely any significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: The findings strongly point to the presence of a healthy donor effect when comparing donors with the general population and active versus lapsed donors. The healthy donor effect was less pronounced within active donors, when comparing long- and short-career donors. Therefore, health research should primarily be carried out within active donors.},

	abstract = {While there is evidence of urban/rural disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage, there is limited data on the influence of other place-based variables. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed population-based linked administrative health data (publicly-funded health insurance database and province-wide immunization repository) to examine vaccination coverage for 3,945,103 residents aged 12 years and above in Alberta, Canada. We used multilevel logistic regression to examine the association of vaccination coverage with various place-based variables. Furthermore, we combined information on vaccine coverage and neighborhood level COVID-19 risk to categorize forward sortation areas (FSAs) into six categories. After 4 months of widely available COVID-19 vaccine, coverage varied widely between rural and urban areas (58\% to 73\%) and between geographic health authority zones (55.8\% to 72.8\%). Residents living in neighborhoods with lower COVID-19 disease incidence had the lowest vaccination coverage (63.2\%), while coverage in higher incidence neighborhoods ranged from 68.3\% to 71.9\%. The multilevel logistic regression model indicated that residence in metro (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.37; 95\% CI: 1.31–1.42) and urban areas (aOR 1.11; 95\% CI: 1.08–1.14) was associated with higher vaccine coverage than residence in rural areas. Similarly, residence in Edmonton, Calgary, and South health zones was associated with higher vaccine coverage compared to residence in Central zone. Higher income neighborhoods reported higher vaccine coverage than the lowest-income neighborhoods, and the highest COVID-19 risk neighborhoods reported higher vaccine coverage than the lowest risk neighborhoods (aOR 1.52; 95\% CI: 1.12–2.05). In the first four months of wider vaccine availability in Alberta, COVID-19 vaccine coverage varied according to various place-based characteristics. Vaccine distribution strategies need to consider place-based variables for program prioritization and delivery.},

This study aims to quantify social determinants of geographic concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases across 16 census metropolitan areas (hereafter, cities) in 4 Canadian provinces, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.Methods: We used surveillance data on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and census data for social determinants at the level of the dissemination area (DA). We calculated Gini coefficients to determine the overall geographic heterogeneity of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in each city, and calculated Gini covariance coefficients to determine each city’s heterogeneity by each social determinant (income, education, housing density and proportions of visible minorities, recent immigrants and essential workers). We visualized heterogeneity using Lorenz (concentration) curves.Results: We observed geographic concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases in cities, as half of the cumulative cases were concentrated in DAs containing 21\%–35\% of their population, with the greatest geographic heterogeneity in Ontario cities (Gini coefficients 0.32–0.47), followed by British Columbia (0.23–0.36), Manitoba (0.32) and Quebec (0.28–0.37). Cases were disproportionately concentrated in areas with lower income and educational attainment, and in areas with a higher proportion of visible minorities, recent immigrants, high-density housing and essential workers. Although a consistent feature across cities was concentration by the proportion of visible minorities, the magnitude of concentration by social determinant varied across cities.Interpretation: Geographic concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases was observed in all of the included cities, but the pattern by social determinants varied. Geographically prioritized allocation of resources and services should be tailored to the local drivers of inequalities in transmission in response to the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2.},

The package implements univariate and multivariate spatial generalised linear mixed models for areal unit data, with inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The response variable can be binomial, Gaussian, multinomial, Poisson or zero-inﬂated Poisson (ZIP), and spatial autocorrelation is modelled by a set of random eﬀects that are assigned a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. A number of diﬀerent models are available for univariate spatial data, including models with no random eﬀects as well as random eﬀects modelled by diﬀerent types of CAR prior. Additionally, a multivariate CAR (MCAR) model for multivariate spatial data is available, as is a two-level hierarchical model for modelling data relating to individuals within areas. The initial creation of this package was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant RES-000-22-4256, and on-going development has been supported by the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) grant EP/J017442/1, ESRC grant ES/K006460/1, Innovate UK / Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) grant NE/N007352/1, and the TB Alliance.},

In England, Greece and Switzerland, the regions most affected were Outer London and the West Midlands (England), Eastern, Western and Central Macedonia (Greece), and Ticino (Switzerland), with 15–20\% excess mortality in 2020. Our study highlights the importance of the large transportation hubs for establishing community transmission in the first stages of the pandemic. Here, we show that acting promptly to limit transmission around these hubs is essential to prevent spread to other regions and countries.},

	abstract = {The standard multilevel regressions that are widely used in neighborhood research typically ignore potential between-neighborhood correlations due to underlying spatial processes, and hence produce inappropriate inferences about neighborhood effects. In contrast, spatial models make estimations and predictions across areas by explicitly modeling the spatial correlations among observations in different locations. A better understanding of the strengths and limitations of spatial models as compared to the standard multilevel model is needed to improve the research on neighborhood and spatial effects. This research systematically compares model estimations and predictions for binary outcomes between (distance- and lattice-based) spatial and the standard multilevel models in the presence of both within- and between-neighborhood correlations, through simulations. Results from simulation analysis reveal that the standard multilevel and spatial models produce similar estimates of fixed effects, but different estimates of random effects variances. Both the standard multilevel and pure spatial models tend to overestimate the corresponding random effects variances, compared to hybrid models when both non-spatial within neighborhood and spatial between-neighborhood effects exist. Spatial models also outperform the standard multilevel model by a narrow margin in case of fully out-of-sample predictions. Distance-based spatial models provide extra spatial information and have stronger predictive power than lattice-based models under certain circumstances. These merits of spatial modeling are exhibited in an empirical analysis of the child mortality data from 1880 Newark, New Jersey.},

The present paper argues the contrary, since many problems in the analysis of spatial data can be interpreted as problems of image restoration. Furthermore, the amounts of data involved allow routine use of computer intensive methods, such as the Gibbs sampler, that are not yet practicable for conventional images.

Nevertheless, geographical differences persist, and vaccine hesitancy is still a major public health concern; understanding its determinants is crucial to managing the COVID-19 pandemic and preparing for future ones. In this cross-sectional population-based study we used cumulative data on the first dose of vaccine received by 01-01-2022 at Middle Super Output Area level in England. We used Bayesian hierarchical spatial models and investigated if the geographical differences in vaccination uptake can be explained by a range of community-level characteristics covering socio-demographics, political view, COVID-19 health risk awareness and targeting of high risk groups and accessibility. Deprivation is the covariate most strongly associated with vaccine uptake (Odds Ratio 0.55, 95\%CI 0.54-0.57; most versus least deprived areas). The most ethnically diverse areas have a 38\% (95\%CI 36-40\%) lower odds of vaccine uptake compared with those least diverse. Areas with the highest proportion of population between 12 and 24 years old had lower odds of vaccination (0.87, 95\%CI 0.85-0.89). Finally increase in vaccine accessibility is associated with COVID-19 vaccine coverage (OR 1.07, 95\%CI 1.03-1.12). Our results suggest that one year after the start of the vaccination programme, there is still evidence of inequalities in uptake, affecting particularly minorities and marginalised groups. Strategies including prioritising active outreach across communities and removing practical barriers and factors that make vaccines less accessible are needed to level up the differences.},

A sample of 19 994 Canadian adults (aged ≥18 years) was recruited from established members of the Angus Reid Forum, a public polling organization. The study comprised 2 phases (phase 1 from May 1 to September 30, 2020, and phase 2 from December 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021) that generally corresponded to the first (April 1 to July 31, 2020) and second (October 1, 2020, to March 1, 2021) viral waves.SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G seropositivity (using a chemiluminescence assay) by major geographic and demographic variables and correlation with COVID-19 symptom reporting.Among 19 994 adults who completed the online questionnaire in phase 1, the mean (SD) age was 50.9 (15.4) years, and 10 522 participants (51.9\%) were female; 2948 participants (14.5\%) had self-identified racial and ethnic minority group status, and 1578 participants (8.2\%) were self-identified Indigenous Canadians. Among participants in phase 1, 8967 had DBS testing. In phase 2, 14 621 adults completed online questionnaires, and 7102 of those had DBS testing. Of 19 994 adults who completed the online survey in phase 1, fewer had an educational level of some college or less (4747 individuals [33.1\%]) compared with the general population in Canada (45.0\%). Survey respondents were otherwise representative of the general population, including in prevalence of known risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among unvaccinated adults increased from 1.9\% in phase 1 to 6.5\% in phase 2. The seropositivity pattern was demographically and geographically heterogeneous during phase 1 but more homogeneous by phase 2 (with a cumulative incidence ranging from 6.4\% to 7.0\% in most regions). The exception was the Atlantic region, in which cumulative incidence reached only 3.3\% (odds ratio [OR] vs Ontario, 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.21-1.02). A total of 47 of 188 adults (25.3\%) reporting COVID-19 symptoms during phase 2 were seropositive, and the OR of seropositivity for COVID-19 symptoms was 6.15 (95\% CI, 2.02-18.69). In phase 2, 94 of 444 seropositive adults (22.2\%) reported having no symptoms. Of 134 seropositive adults in phase 1 who were retested in phase 2, 111 individuals (81.8\%) remained seropositive. Participants who had a history of diabetes (OR, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.38-0.90) had lower odds of having detectable antibodies in phase 2.The Action to Beat Coronavirus study found that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Canada was modest until March 2021, and this incidence was lower than the levels of population immunity required to substantially reduce transmission of the virus. Ongoing vaccination efforts remain central to reducing viral transmission and mortality. Assessment of future infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity is practicable through the use of serial online surveys and participant-collected DBS.},

	abstract = {Background
Accurate seroprevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations could clarify the extent to which current testing strategies are identifying all active infection, and hence the true magnitude and spread of the infection. Our primary objective was to identify valid seroprevalence studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and compare their estimates with the reported, and imputed, COVID-19 case rates within the same population at the same time point.

Methods
We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe-PMC for published studies and pre-prints that reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and/or IgA antibodies for serosurveys of the general community from 1 Jan to 12 Aug 2020.

Results
Of the 2199 studies identified, 170 were assessed for full text and 17 studies representing 15 regions and 118,297 subjects were includable. The seroprevalence proportions in 8 studies ranged between 1\%-10\%, with 5 studies under 1\%, and 4 over 10\%—from the notably hard-hit regions of Gangelt, Germany; Northwest Iran; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Stockholm, Sweden. For seropositive cases who were not previously identified as COVID-19 cases, the majority had prior COVID-like symptoms. The estimated seroprevalences ranged from 0.56–717 times greater than the number of reported cumulative cases–half of the studies reported greater than 10 times more SARS-CoV-2 infections than the cumulative number of cases.

Conclusions
The findings show SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence is well below “herd immunity” in all countries studied. The estimated number of infections, however, were much greater than the number of reported cases and deaths in almost all locations. The majority of seropositive people reported prior COVID-like symptoms, suggesting that undertesting of symptomatic people may be causing a substantial under-ascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.},

	abstract = {Background
When analysing spatial data, it is important to account for spatial autocorrelation. In Bayesian statistics, spatial autocorrelation is commonly modelled by the intrinsic conditional autoregressive prior distribution. At the heart of this model is a spatial weights matrix which controls the behaviour and degree of spatial smoothing. The purpose of this study is to review the main specifications of the spatial weights matrix found in the literature, and together with some new and less common specifications, compare the effect that they have on smoothing and model performance.

Methods
The popular BYM model is described, and a simple solution for addressing the identifiability issue among the spatial random effects is provided. Seventeen different definitions of the spatial weights matrix are defined, which are classified into four classes: adjacency-based weights, and weights based on geographic distance, distance between covariate values, and a hybrid of geographic and covariate distances. These last two definitions embody the main novelty of this research. Three synthetic data sets are generated, each representing a different underlying spatial structure. These data sets together with a real spatial data set from the literature are analysed using the models. The models are evaluated using the deviance information criterion and Moran’s I statistic.

Results
The deviance information criterion indicated that the model which uses binary, first-order adjacency weights to perform spatial smoothing is generally an optimal choice for achieving a good model fit. Distance-based weights also generally perform quite well and offer similar parameter interpretations. The less commonly explored options for performing spatial smoothing generally provided a worse model fit than models with more traditional approaches to smoothing, but usually outperformed the benchmark model which did not conduct spatial smoothing.

Conclusions
The specification of the spatial weights matrix can have a colossal impact on model fit and parameter estimation. The results provide some evidence that a smaller number of neighbours used in defining the spatial weights matrix yields a better model fit, and may provide a more accurate representation of the underlying spatial random field. The commonly used binary, first-order adjacency weights still appear to be a good choice for implementing spatial smoothing.

Generalized linear models however, overlook the spatial component of land-use data, and its effects on statistical inference. Spatial autocorrelation may artificially reduce variance in observations, and inflate the effect size of covariates. To uncover the consequences of overlooking this spatial component, we tested both spatially explicit and non-spatial models of deforestation for Colombia. Parameter estimates, analyses of residual spatial autocorrelation, and Bayesian posterior predictive checks were used to compare model performance. Significant residual correlation showed that non-spatial models failed to adequately explain the spatial structure of the data. Posterior predictive checks revealed that spatially explicit models had strong predictive power for the entire range of the response variable and only failed to predict outliers, in contrast with non-spatial models, which lacked predictive power for all response values. The predictive power of non-spatial models was especially low in regions away from Colombia's center, where about half the observations were clustered. While all analyses consistently identified a core of important covariates of deforestation rates, predictive modeling requires parameter estimates informed by the spatial structure of the data. To inform increasingly important forest and carbon sequestration policy, land-use models must account for spatial autocorrelation.},

	abstract = {While there is evidence of urban/rural disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage, there is limited data on the influence of other place-based variables. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed population-based linked administrative health data (publicly-funded health insurance database and province-wide immunization repository) to examine vaccination coverage for 3,945,103 residents aged 12 years and above in Alberta, Canada. We used multilevel logistic regression to examine the association of vaccination coverage with various place-based variables. Furthermore, we combined information on vaccine coverage and neighborhood level COVID-19 risk to categorize forward sortation areas (FSAs) into six categories. After 4 months of widely available COVID-19 vaccine, coverage varied widely between rural and urban areas (58\% to 73\%) and between geographic health authority zones (55.8\% to 72.8\%). Residents living in neighborhoods with lower COVID-19 disease incidence had the lowest vaccination coverage (63.2\%), while coverage in higher incidence neighborhoods ranged from 68.3\% to 71.9\%. The multilevel logistic regression model indicated that residence in metro (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.37; 95\% CI: 1.31–1.42) and urban areas (aOR 1.11; 95\% CI: 1.08–1.14) was associated with higher vaccine coverage than residence in rural areas. Similarly, residence in Edmonton, Calgary, and South health zones was associated with higher vaccine coverage compared to residence in Central zone. Higher income neighborhoods reported higher vaccine coverage than the lowest-income neighborhoods, and the highest COVID-19 risk neighborhoods reported higher vaccine coverage than the lowest risk neighborhoods (aOR 1.52; 95\% CI: 1.12–2.05). In the first four months of wider vaccine availability in Alberta, COVID-19 vaccine coverage varied according to various place-based characteristics. Vaccine distribution strategies need to consider place-based variables for program prioritization and delivery.},

This study aims to quantify social determinants of geographic concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases across 16 census metropolitan areas (hereafter, cities) in 4 Canadian provinces, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.Methods: We used surveillance data on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and census data for social determinants at the level of the dissemination area (DA). We calculated Gini coefficients to determine the overall geographic heterogeneity of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in each city, and calculated Gini covariance coefficients to determine each city’s heterogeneity by each social determinant (income, education, housing density and proportions of visible minorities, recent immigrants and essential workers). We visualized heterogeneity using Lorenz (concentration) curves.Results: We observed geographic concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases in cities, as half of the cumulative cases were concentrated in DAs containing 21\%–35\% of their population, with the greatest geographic heterogeneity in Ontario cities (Gini coefficients 0.32–0.47), followed by British Columbia (0.23–0.36), Manitoba (0.32) and Quebec (0.28–0.37). Cases were disproportionately concentrated in areas with lower income and educational attainment, and in areas with a higher proportion of visible minorities, recent immigrants, high-density housing and essential workers. Although a consistent feature across cities was concentration by the proportion of visible minorities, the magnitude of concentration by social determinant varied across cities.Interpretation: Geographic concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases was observed in all of the included cities, but the pattern by social determinants varied. Geographically prioritized allocation of resources and services should be tailored to the local drivers of inequalities in transmission in response to the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2.},

The package implements univariate and multivariate spatial generalised linear mixed models for areal unit data, with inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The response variable can be binomial, Gaussian, multinomial, Poisson or zero-inﬂated Poisson (ZIP), and spatial autocorrelation is modelled by a set of random eﬀects that are assigned a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. A number of diﬀerent models are available for univariate spatial data, including models with no random eﬀects as well as random eﬀects modelled by diﬀerent types of CAR prior. Additionally, a multivariate CAR (MCAR) model for multivariate spatial data is available, as is a two-level hierarchical model for modelling data relating to individuals within areas. The initial creation of this package was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant RES-000-22-4256, and on-going development has been supported by the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) grant EP/J017442/1, ESRC grant ES/K006460/1, Innovate UK / Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) grant NE/N007352/1, and the TB Alliance.},

	abstract = {The standard multilevel regressions that are widely used in neighborhood research typically ignore potential between-neighborhood correlations due to underlying spatial processes, and hence produce inappropriate inferences about neighborhood effects. In contrast, spatial models make estimations and predictions across areas by explicitly modeling the spatial correlations among observations in different locations. A better understanding of the strengths and limitations of spatial models as compared to the standard multilevel model is needed to improve the research on neighborhood and spatial effects. This research systematically compares model estimations and predictions for binary outcomes between (distance- and lattice-based) spatial and the standard multilevel models in the presence of both within- and between-neighborhood correlations, through simulations. Results from simulation analysis reveal that the standard multilevel and spatial models produce similar estimates of fixed effects, but different estimates of random effects variances. Both the standard multilevel and pure spatial models tend to overestimate the corresponding random effects variances, compared to hybrid models when both non-spatial within neighborhood and spatial between-neighborhood effects exist. Spatial models also outperform the standard multilevel model by a narrow margin in case of fully out-of-sample predictions. Distance-based spatial models provide extra spatial information and have stronger predictive power than lattice-based models under certain circumstances. These merits of spatial modeling are exhibited in an empirical analysis of the child mortality data from 1880 Newark, New Jersey.},

Perhaps the most straightforward task is that of image restoration, though it is often suggested that this is an area of relatively minor practical importance. The present paper argues the contrary, since many problems in the analysis of spatial data can be interpreted as problems of image restoration. Furthermore, the amounts of data involved allow routine use of computer intensive methods, such as the Gibbs sampler, that are not yet practicable for conventional images. Two examples are given, one in archeology, the other in epidemiology. These are preceded by a partial review of pixel-based Bayesian image analysis.},

We observe a better performance of the MLM tCARs, to retrieve the true regression coefficients and with better fit. Secondly, it provides a comprehensive decision tree for analysing data in epidemiological studies with spatially nested structure: we also consider the Multilevel CAR models (MLM CARs) for cross-sectional studies in simulation studies.

Nevertheless, geographical differences persist, and vaccine hesitancy is still a major public health concern; understanding its determinants is crucial to managing the COVID-19 pandemic and preparing for future ones. In this cross-sectional population-based study we used cumulative data on the first dose of vaccine received by 01-01-2022 at Middle Super Output Area level in England. We used Bayesian hierarchical spatial models and investigated if the geographical differences in vaccination uptake can be explained by a range of community-level characteristics covering socio-demographics, political view, COVID-19 health risk awareness and targeting of high risk groups and accessibility. Deprivation is the covariate most strongly associated with vaccine uptake (Odds Ratio 0.55, 95\%CI 0.54-0.57; most versus least deprived areas). The most ethnically diverse areas have a 38\% (95\%CI 36-40\%) lower odds of vaccine uptake compared with those least diverse. Areas with the highest proportion of population between 12 and 24 years old had lower odds of vaccination (0.87, 95\%CI 0.85-0.89). Finally increase in vaccine accessibility is associated with COVID-19 vaccine coverage (OR 1.07, 95\%CI 1.03-1.12). Our results suggest that one year after the start of the vaccination programme, there is still evidence of inequalities in uptake, affecting particularly minorities and marginalised groups. Strategies including prioritising active outreach across communities and removing practical barriers and factors that make vaccines less accessible are needed to level up the differences.},

A sample of 19 994 Canadian adults (aged ≥18 years) was recruited from established members of the Angus Reid Forum, a public polling organization. The study comprised 2 phases (phase 1 from May 1 to September 30, 2020, and phase 2 from December 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021) that generally corresponded to the first (April 1 to July 31, 2020) and second (October 1, 2020, to March 1, 2021) viral waves.SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G seropositivity (using a chemiluminescence assay) by major geographic and demographic variables and correlation with COVID-19 symptom reporting.Among 19 994 adults who completed the online questionnaire in phase 1, the mean (SD) age was 50.9 (15.4) years, and 10 522 participants (51.9\%) were female; 2948 participants (14.5\%) had self-identified racial and ethnic minority group status, and 1578 participants (8.2\%) were self-identified Indigenous Canadians. Among participants in phase 1, 8967 had DBS testing. In phase 2, 14 621 adults completed online questionnaires, and 7102 of those had DBS testing. Of 19 994 adults who completed the online survey in phase 1, fewer had an educational level of some college or less (4747 individuals [33.1\%]) compared with the general population in Canada (45.0\%). Survey respondents were otherwise representative of the general population, including in prevalence of known risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among unvaccinated adults increased from 1.9\% in phase 1 to 6.5\% in phase 2. The seropositivity pattern was demographically and geographically heterogeneous during phase 1 but more homogeneous by phase 2 (with a cumulative incidence ranging from 6.4\% to 7.0\% in most regions). The exception was the Atlantic region, in which cumulative incidence reached only 3.3\% (odds ratio [OR] vs Ontario, 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.21-1.02). A total of 47 of 188 adults (25.3\%) reporting COVID-19 symptoms during phase 2 were seropositive, and the OR of seropositivity for COVID-19 symptoms was 6.15 (95\% CI, 2.02-18.69). In phase 2, 94 of 444 seropositive adults (22.2\%) reported having no symptoms. Of 134 seropositive adults in phase 1 who were retested in phase 2, 111 individuals (81.8\%) remained seropositive. Participants who had a history of diabetes (OR, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.38-0.90) had lower odds of having detectable antibodies in phase 2.The Action to Beat Coronavirus study found that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Canada was modest until March 2021, and this incidence was lower than the levels of population immunity required to substantially reduce transmission of the virus. Ongoing vaccination efforts remain central to reducing viral transmission and mortality. Assessment of future infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity is practicable through the use of serial online surveys and participant-collected DBS.},

	abstract = {Background
Accurate seroprevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations could clarify the extent to which current testing strategies are identifying all active infection, and hence the true magnitude and spread of the infection. Our primary objective was to identify valid seroprevalence studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and compare their estimates with the reported, and imputed, COVID-19 case rates within the same population at the same time point.

Methods
We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe-PMC for published studies and pre-prints that reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and/or IgA antibodies for serosurveys of the general community from 1 Jan to 12 Aug 2020.

Results
Of the 2199 studies identified, 170 were assessed for full text and 17 studies representing 15 regions and 118,297 subjects were includable. The seroprevalence proportions in 8 studies ranged between 1\%-10\%, with 5 studies under 1\%, and 4 over 10\%—from the notably hard-hit regions of Gangelt, Germany; Northwest Iran; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Stockholm, Sweden. For seropositive cases who were not previously identified as COVID-19 cases, the majority had prior COVID-like symptoms. The estimated seroprevalences ranged from 0.56–717 times greater than the number of reported cumulative cases–half of the studies reported greater than 10 times more SARS-CoV-2 infections than the cumulative number of cases.

Conclusions
The findings show SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence is well below “herd immunity” in all countries studied. The estimated number of infections, however, were much greater than the number of reported cases and deaths in almost all locations. The majority of seropositive people reported prior COVID-like symptoms, suggesting that undertesting of symptomatic people may be causing a substantial under-ascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.},

	abstract = {Background
When analysing spatial data, it is important to account for spatial autocorrelation. In Bayesian statistics, spatial autocorrelation is commonly modelled by the intrinsic conditional autoregressive prior distribution. At the heart of this model is a spatial weights matrix which controls the behaviour and degree of spatial smoothing. The purpose of this study is to review the main specifications of the spatial weights matrix found in the literature, and together with some new and less common specifications, compare the effect that they have on smoothing and model performance.

Methods
The popular BYM model is described, and a simple solution for addressing the identifiability issue among the spatial random effects is provided. Seventeen different definitions of the spatial weights matrix are defined, which are classified into four classes: adjacency-based weights, and weights based on geographic distance, distance between covariate values, and a hybrid of geographic and covariate distances. These last two definitions embody the main novelty of this research. Three synthetic data sets are generated, each representing a different underlying spatial structure. These data sets together with a real spatial data set from the literature are analysed using the models. The models are evaluated using the deviance information criterion and Moran’s I statistic.

Results
The deviance information criterion indicated that the model which uses binary, first-order adjacency weights to perform spatial smoothing is generally an optimal choice for achieving a good model fit. Distance-based weights also generally perform quite well and offer similar parameter interpretations. The less commonly explored options for performing spatial smoothing generally provided a worse model fit than models with more traditional approaches to smoothing, but usually outperformed the benchmark model which did not conduct spatial smoothing.

Conclusions
The specification of the spatial weights matrix can have a colossal impact on model fit and parameter estimation. The results provide some evidence that a smaller number of neighbours used in defining the spatial weights matrix yields a better model fit, and may provide a more accurate representation of the underlying spatial random field. The commonly used binary, first-order adjacency weights still appear to be a good choice for implementing spatial smoothing.

Generalized linear models however, overlook the spatial component of land-use data, and its effects on statistical inference. Spatial autocorrelation may artificially reduce variance in observations, and inflate the effect size of covariates. To uncover the consequences of overlooking this spatial component, we tested both spatially explicit and non-spatial models of deforestation for Colombia. Parameter estimates, analyses of residual spatial autocorrelation, and Bayesian posterior predictive checks were used to compare model performance. Significant residual correlation showed that non-spatial models failed to adequately explain the spatial structure of the data. Posterior predictive checks revealed that spatially explicit models had strong predictive power for the entire range of the response variable and only failed to predict outliers, in contrast with non-spatial models, which lacked predictive power for all response values. The predictive power of non-spatial models was especially low in regions away from Colombia's center, where about half the observations were clustered. While all analyses consistently identified a core of important covariates of deforestation rates, predictive modeling requires parameter estimates informed by the spatial structure of the data. To inform increasingly important forest and carbon sequestration policy, land-use models must account for spatial autocorrelation.},

Traditionally, the variables used to explain the species richness on an island are its area and distance to the mainland. However, increasing evidence suggests that accounting for other variables is essential for better estimates. In particular, the distance between islands should play a role in determining species richness. This work uses a Bayesian framework using Gaussian processes to assess whether distance to neighbouring islands (spatial autocorrelation) can better explain arthropod species richness patterns in the Azores Archipelago and in the Canary Islands. This method is flexible and allows the inclusion of other variables, such as maximum altitude above sea level (elevation). The results show that accounting for spatial autocorrelation provides the best results for both archipelagos, but overall, spatial autocorrelation seems to be more important in the Canary archipelago. Similarly, elevation plays a more important role in determining species richness in the Canary Islands. We recommend that spatial autocorrelation should always be considered when modelling an archipelago’s species richness.},

	abstract = {We systematically evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity in a provincial cohort to understand the local epidemiology of COVID-19 and support evidence-based public health decisions. Residual blood samples were collected for serology testing over 5-day periods monthly from June 2020 to January 2021 from six clinical laboratories across the province of Alberta, Canada. A total of 93,993 individual patient samples were tested with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody assay with positives confirmed using a spike antibody assay. Population-adjusted SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity was 0.92\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91 to 0.93\%) shortly after the first COVID-19 wave in June 2020, increasing to 4.63\% (95\% CI: 4.61 to 4.65\%) amid the second wave in January 2021. There was no significant difference in seropositivity between males and females (1.39\% versus 1.27\%; P = 0.11). Ages with highest seropositivity were 0 to 9 years (2.71\%, 95\% CI: 1.64 to 3.78\%) followed by 20 to 29 years (1.58\%, 95\% CI: 1.12 to 2.04\%), with the lowest rates seen in those aged 70 to 79 (0.79\%, 95\% CI: 0.65 to 0.93\%) and {\textgreater}80 (0.78\%, 95\% CI: 0.60 to 0.97\%). Compared to the seronegative group, seropositive patients inhabited geographic areas with lower household income (\$87,500 versus \$97,500; P {\textless} 0.001), larger household sizes, and higher proportions of people with education levels of secondary school or lower, as well as immigrants and visible minority groups (all P {\textless} 0.05). A total of 53.7\% of seropositive individuals were potentially undetected cases with no prior positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test (NAAT). Antibodies were detectable in some patients up to 9 months post positive NAAT result. This seroprevalence study will continue to inform public health decisions by identifying at-risk demographics and geographical areas.
IMPORTANCE Using SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, we assessed the proportion of people in Alberta, Canada (population 4.4 million) positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating previous infection, during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic (prior to vaccination programs). Linking these results with sociodemographic population data provides valuable information as to which groups of the population are more likely to have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus to help facilitate public health decision-making and interventions. We also compared seropositivity data with previous COVID-19 molecular testing results. Absence of antibody and molecular testing were highly correlated (95\% negative concordance). Positive antibody correlation with a previous positive molecular test was low, suggesting the possibility of mild/asymptomatic infection or other reasons leading individuals from seeking medical attention. Our data highlight that the true estimate of population prevalence of COVID-19 is likely best informed by combining data from both serology and molecular testing.},

	abstract = {Background Surveillance of blood donors is fundamental to safety of the blood supply. Such data can also be useful for public health policy but tend to be underutilized. When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, blood centers around the world measured blood donor SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence to inform public health policy. There is now a movement toward blood centers becoming more involved in public health research and surveillance post-pandemic. However, blood donors are a healthy population and not representative of all segments of the general population. In this article, we explain how blood centers can evaluate their donor base to understand which part of the general population they are representative of. Study Design and Methods Methodologic approaches for evaluating samples relative to the target population were reviewed. Blood donor data that are available to most blood centers were identified and application to assess representativeness of blood donors was evaluated. Results Key aspects of blood donor data to compare with general population data include donor selection criteria, health indicators, geography, and demographics. In some cases, statistical adjustment can improve representativeness. Discussion Comparing key blood donor data with corresponding general population data can define the subset of the general population for which a particular blood center's donors may be representative of. We suggest that donors are an ideal convenience population for surveillance of infectious agents which are frequently asymptomatic and main routes of transmission are not deferrable, for studying the natural history of disease in an initially well population, and for vaccination serology surveillance.},

Yet the scope of partnerships between blood services and PH authorities is inadequately documented. We explored how blood services partner with PH authorities outside the scope of COVID-19. Materials and Methods On 19 January 2022, survey was sent to employees of blood services located throughout the world. Survey questions mainly pertained to partnerships with PH authorities, including how blood specimens are used and collected. Results Twenty-seven recipients—4 (14.8\%) in Africa, 3 (11.1\%) in Asia, 9 (33.3\%) in Europe, 6 (22.2\%) in North America, 2 (7.4\%) in Oceania and 3 (11.1\%) in South America—completed the survey. Fifteen recipients (55.6\%) indicated their blood service was directly or indirectly supervised by PH authorities. Twenty-four recipients (88.9\%) indicated currently using or planning to use blood donor data or samples for PH research or pathogen surveillance. A substantial proportion of respondents reported using samples or results from non-routine tests for the surveillance of non-transfusion-transmitted infectious disease pathogens (n = 13 [48.1\%]); samples or results of non-routine tests for PH research unrelated to pathogens (n = 10 [37.0\%]); donor data for PH research unrelated to pathogens (n = 12 [44.4\%]) and donor data for PH research unrelated to transfusion safety (n = 11 [40.7\%]). Fourteen (51.9\%) had established (or planned to establish) longitudinal cohorts and 19 (70.4\%) biobanks.

	abstract = {Objectives: To overcome the absence of socio-economic information in administrative databases and to monitor social inequalities in health, a material and social deprivation index was developed for Québec and Canada. Methods: The index is based on the smallest area unit used in Canadian censuses, with 400 to 700 persons on average. It includes six socio-economic indicators grouped along two dimensions - material and social - produced from principal component analyses. The index exists for 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 and in different versions, from local areas to the whole of Canada. Numerous products related to the index are available online free of charge. Results: The index has been used extensively in the field of health and social services, mainly in the province of Québec but also elsewhere in Canada. It has had four main uses, all related to public health: describing geographic variations of deprivation, illustrating inequalities in population health status and in service use according to deprivation, supporting the development of health reports and policies, and guiding regional resource allocation. These applications are facilitated by a close partnership between the producers and users of the index. Conclusion: The deprivation index is a marker of social inequalities in health. It allows for monitoring of inequalities over time and space, and constitutes a useful tool for public health planning, intervention and service delivery.},

Anti-S concentration was high initially (3306 U/mL, IQR 4280 U/mL), increased to (13,659 U/mL, IQR 28,224 U/mL) by June (p {\textless} 0.001), following the pattern of deployment of the third and fourth vaccine doses and was higher in those that were anti-N positive (p {\textless} 0.001). Despite already high vaccination-related seroprevalence, infection-related seroprevalence increased dramatically with the emergence of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives The infrastructure established for screening blood donations for hepatitis C virus has enabled large-scale population testing for other viruses which are potentially transmissible by transfusion of blood components and plasma-derived blood products. We have measured the frequency of viraemia of enteroviruses and parechoviruses in 83 600 Scottish blood donors to allow an initial assessment of their risk to blood safety. Materials and Methods Plasma samples collected from blood donors over 7 calendar months were tested anonymously in mini-pools of 95 donations, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for human enterovirus and parechovirus sequences. Results A total of 19 mini-pools, from the 880 that were tested, were PCR-positive for enterovirus RNA, predicting a donor prevalence of 0·023\%. Enterovirus sequences were not detected in factor VIII or IX clotting factor concentrates. None of the 230 mini-pools or concentrates contained detectable parechovirus RNA. Conclusions The prevalence of enterovirus viraemia detected in this study predicts that at least 1000 enterovirus-contaminated blood components are transfused per year in the UK. The frequency of transmission and clinical outcome after exposure to enterovirus-contaminated blood components in recipients is unknown.},

There is a need, therefore, for a surveillance program that can give sufficient warning of outbreaks of the disease so that highly focused preventative measures may be undertaken. The ability of a surveillance program, based on voluntary Red Cross blood donations, to predict outbreaks of epidemic polyarthritis was evaluated. Anti-RRV IgM antibody was detected in significant numbers of blood donors from throughout the state of Queensland 6-9 weeks prior to an increase in the number of notified cases of epidemic polyarthritis. At a local level, significant numbers of anti-RRV IgM blood donors were detected in Brisbane in 1996 four weeks prior to an increase in the number of notified cases of epidemic polyarthritis. This system of surveillance is technically simple, rapid (results are obtained in 2-3 days), it samples the human population from throughout the state, and it gives timely warning of outbreaks of epidemic polyarthritis.},

	abstract = {Background: During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of reported cases of COVID-19 among Canadians was under 6\%. Although high vaccine coverage was achieved in Canada by fall 2021, the Omicron variant caused unprecedented numbers of infections, overwhelming testing capacity and making it difficult to quantify the trajectory of population immunity.
Methods: Using a time-series approach and data from more than 900 000 samples collected by 7 research studies collaborating with the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force (CITF), we estimated trends in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence owing to infection and vaccination for the Canadian population over 3 intervals: prevaccination (March to November 2020), vaccine roll-out (December 2020 to November 2021), and the arrival of the Omicron variant (December 2021 to March 2023). We also estimated seroprevalence by geographical region and age.
Results: By November 2021, 9.0\% (95\% credible interval [CrI] 7.3\%–11\%) of people in Canada had humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 from an infection. Seroprevalence increased rapidly after the arrival of the Omicron variant — by Mar. 15, 2023, 76\% (95\% CrI 74\%–79\%) of the population had detectable antibodies from infections. The rapid rise in infection-induced antibodies occurred across Canada and was most pronounced in younger age groups and in the Western provinces: Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.
Interpretation: Data up to March 2023 indicate that most people in Canada had acquired antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 through natural infection and vaccination. However, given variations in population seropositivity by age and geography, the potential for waning antibody levels, and new variants that may escape immunity, public health policy and clinical decisions should be tailored to local patterns of population immunity.},

Inequalities in the incidence of COVID-19 have been described. However, no studies have examined the daily trends of socioeconomic inequalities and how they changed during the different phases of the pandemic. The aim of this study is to analyse the dynamic socioeconomic inequalities in the incidence of COVID-19 during the six waves in Barcelona.We examined the proportion of daily cases observed in the census tracts in the lower income tercile compared with the proportion of daily cases observed in the sum of the lower and higher income terciles. Daily differences in these proportions were assessed as a function of the epidemic waves, sex, age group, daily incidence and daily change in the incidence. A logistic regression model with an autoregressive term was used for statistical analysis.A time-dynamic effect was found for socioeconomic inequalities in the incidence of COVID-19. In fact, belonging to a lower-income area changed from being a risk factor (Waves 1, 2, 4 and 5) to being a protective factor in the sixth wave of the pandemic. Age also had a significant effect on incidence, which also changed over the different waves of the pandemic. Finally, the lower-income areas showed a comparatively lower incidence during the ascending phase of the epidemic waves.Socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 changed by wave, age group and wave phase.},

        , The socio-demographic factors have a substantial impact on the overall casualties caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19). In this study, the global and local spatial association between the key socio-demographic variables and COVID-19 cases and deaths in the European regions were analyzed using the spatial regression models. A total of 31 European countries were selected for modelling and subsequent analysis. From the initial 28 socio-demographic variables, a total of 2 (for COVID-19 cases) and 3 (for COVID-19 deaths) key variables were filtered out for the regression modelling. The spatially explicit regression modelling and mapping were done using four spatial regression models such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Spatial Error Model (SEM), Spatial Lag Model (SLM), and Ordinary Least Square (OLS). Additionally, Partial Least Square (PLS) and Principal Component Regression (PCR) was performed to estimate the overall explanatory power of the regression models. For the COVID cases, the local R2 values, which suggesting the influences of the selected socio-demographic variables on COVID cases and death, were found highest in Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, Italy. The moderate local R2 was observed for Luxembourg, Poland, Denmark, Croatia, Belgium, Slovakia. The lowest local R2 value for COVID-19 cases was accounted for Ireland, Portugal, United Kingdom, Spain, Cyprus, Romania. Among the 2 variables, the highest local R2 was calculated for income (R2 = 0.71), followed by poverty (R2 = 0.45). For the COVID deaths, the highest association was found in Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria. The moderate association was documented for Hungary, Greece, Switzerland, Slovakia, and the lower association was found in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Netherlands, Cyprus. This suggests that the selected demographic and socio-economic components, including total population, poverty, income, are the key factors in regulating overall casualties of COVID-19 in the European region. In this study, the influence of the other controlling factors, such as environmental conditions, socio-ecological status, climatic extremity, etc. have not been considered. This could be the scope for future research.},

Methods We conducted a population-based study of 28,808 COVID-19 cases in the provincial reportable infectious disease surveillance systems (Public Health Case and Contact Management System) which includes all known COVID-19 infections and deaths from Ontario, Canada reported between January 23, 2020 and July 28, 2020. Residents of congregate settings, Indigenous communities living on reserves or small neighbourhoods with populations {\textless}1,000 were excluded. Comparing neighbourhoods in the 90th to the 10th percentiles of socio-demographic characteristics, we estimated the associations between 18 neighbourhood-level measures of immigration, race, housing and socio-economic characteristics and COVID-19 incidence and mortality using Poisson generalized linear mixed models. Results Neighbourhoods with the highest proportion of immigrants (relative risk (RR): 4.0, 95\%CI:3.5–4.5) and visible minority residents (RR: 3.3, 95\%CI:2.9–3.7) showed the strongest association with COVID-19 incidence in adjusted models. Among individual race groups, COVID-19 incidence was highest among neighbourhoods with the high proportions of Black (RR: 2.4, 95\%CI:2.2–2.6), South Asian (RR: 1.9, 95\%CI:1.8–2.1), Latin American (RR: 1.8, 95\%CI:1.6–2.0) and Middle Eastern (RR: 1.2, 95\%CI:1.1–1.3) residents. Neighbourhoods with the highest average household size (RR: 1.9, 95\%CI:1.7–2.1), proportion of multigenerational families (RR: 1.8, 95\%CI:1.7–2.0) and unsuitably crowded housing (RR: 2.1, 95\%CI:2.0–2.3) were associated with COVID-19 incidence. Neighbourhoods with the highest proportion of residents with less than high school education (RR: 1.6, 95\%CI:1.4–1.8), low income (RR: 1.4, 95\%CI:1.2–1.5) and unaffordable housing (RR: 1.6, 95\%CI:1.4–1.8) were associated with COVID-19 incidence. Similar inequities were observed across neighbourhood-level sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 mortality. Conclusions Neighbourhood-level inequities in COVID-19 incidence and mortality were observed in Ontario, with excess burden experienced in neighbourhoods with a higher proportion of immigrants, racialized populations, large households and low socio-economic status.},

	abstract = {Background Our understanding of the global scale of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains incomplete: Routine surveillance data underestimate infection and cannot infer on population immunity; there is a predominance of asymptomatic infections, and uneven access to diagnostics. We meta-analyzed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies, standardized to those described in the World Health Organization’s Unity protocol (WHO Unity) for general population seroepidemiological studies, to estimate the extent of population infection and seropositivity to the virus 2 years into the pandemic. Methods and findings We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, preprints, and grey literature for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence published between January 1, 2020 and May 20, 2022. The review protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020183634). We included general population cross-sectional and cohort studies meeting an assay quality threshold (90\% sensitivity, 97\% specificity; exceptions for humanitarian settings). We excluded studies with an unclear or closed population sample frame. Eligible studies—those aligned with the WHO Unity protocol—were extracted and critically appraised in duplicate, with risk of bias evaluated using a modified Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. We meta-analyzed seroprevalence by country and month, pooling to estimate regional and global seroprevalence over time; compared seroprevalence from infection to confirmed cases to estimate underascertainment; meta-analyzed differences in seroprevalence between demographic subgroups such as age and sex; and identified national factors associated with seroprevalence using meta-regression. We identified 513 full texts reporting 965 distinct seroprevalence studies (41\% low- and middle-income countries [LMICs]) sampling 5,346,069 participants between January 2020 and April 2022, including 459 low/moderate risk of bias studies with national/subnational scope in further analysis. By September 2021, global SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from infection or vaccination was 59.2\%, 95\% CI [56.1\% to 62.2\%]. Overall seroprevalence rose steeply in 2021 due to infection in some regions (e.g., 26.6\% [24.6 to 28.8] to 86.7\% [84.6\% to 88.5\%] in Africa in December 2021) and vaccination and infection in others (e.g., 9.6\% [8.3\% to 11.0\%] in June 2020 to 95.9\% [92.6\% to 97.8\%] in December 2021, in European high-income countries [HICs]). After the emergence of Omicron in March 2022, infection-induced seroprevalence rose to 47.9\% [41.0\% to 54.9\%] in Europe HIC and 33.7\% [31.6\% to 36.0\%] in Americas HIC. In 2021 Quarter Three (July to September), median seroprevalence to cumulative incidence ratios ranged from around 2:1 in the Americas and Europe HICs to over 100:1 in Africa (LMICs). Children 0 to 9 years and adults 60+ were at lower risk of seropositivity than adults 20 to 29 (p {\textless} 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively). In a multivariable model using prevaccination data, stringent public health and social measures were associated with lower seroprevalence (p = 0.02). The main limitations of our methodology include that some estimates were driven by certain countries or populations being overrepresented. Conclusions In this study, we observed that global seroprevalence has risen considerably over time and with regional variation; however, over one-third of the global population are seronegative to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our estimates of infections based on seroprevalence far exceed reported Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Quality and standardized seroprevalence studies are essential to inform COVID-19 response, particularly in resource-limited regions.},
