Code repository for the manuscript 'COVID-19 SEROPOSITIVITY ACROSS SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND GEOGRAPHIC SUBGROUPS OF CANADIAN BLOOD DONORS THROUGH THE OMICRON PERIOD'


The `1_data` directory contains data we are able to share publicly. This does not include the patient level data from CBS. Because those data are not public, this repository can not be used to replicate our findings. 


The `2_scripts` directory includes all code run to generate the analysis, except for some formatting code embedded in the manuscript .qmd file.

The folder `3_intermediate` was not used in this analysis.

The `4_output` contains figures and tables generated by the scripts in `2_scripts`, most of which are used in the manuscript.


The `5_manuscript` directory contains the .qmd file used to generate the manuscript as a Microsoft Word document and the resulting Word document, together with files for generating the reference list.
